# Background
Objective: To explore and visualize extensive Olympic Games data to identify trends, top-performing countries, athletes, and gender distribution across various Olympic events and seasons.


### The questions I wanted to answer:

1. Distribution of medals among male and female athletes?
2. What countries participated in almost every Olympic Season?
3. Participants and Events by Season?
4. Medals distribution by Athletes, Countries and Sports throughout the Year's?
5. Athletes Participations and Medal Winning Analysis?


# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the analysis, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **MySQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **PowerBI:** My go-to for analysis and visualization.
- **Excel:** The handy tool for Data manipulation.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.


### 1. Distribution of medals among male and female athletes
To identify the results, I filtered medals data by gender and season. This result highlights that Male and Female gender won most of medals in Summer and Winter season respectively.


Here's the breakdown of result:
- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.
- **Diverse Employers:** Companies like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries.
- **Job Title Variety:** There's a high diversity in job titles, from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data analytics.


### 2. Countries participated in almost every Olympic Season
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for the top 10 highest paying data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **SQL** is leading with a bold count of 8.
- **Python** follows closely with a bold count of 7.
- **Tableau** is also highly sought after, with a bold count of 6.
Other skills like **R**, **Snowflake**, **Pandas**, and **Excel** show varying degrees of demand.


### 3. Participants and Events by Season?

This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.

Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for data analysts in 2023
