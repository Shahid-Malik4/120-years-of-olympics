# Background
Objective: To explore and visualize extensive Olympic Games data to identify trends, top-performing countries, athletes, and gender distribution across various Olympic events and seasons.


### The questions I wanted to answer:

1. Distribution of medals among male and female athletes?
2. What countries participated in almost every Olympic Season?
3. Participants and Events by Season?
4. Medals distribution by Athletes, Countries and Sports throughout the Year's?
5. Athletes Participations and Medal Winning Analysis?


# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the analysis, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **MySQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **PowerBI:** My go-to for analysis and visualization.
- **Excel:** The handy tool for Data manipulation.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# What I Learned

Throughout this adventure, I've turbocharged my SQL toolkit with some serious firepower:

- **ðŸ§© Complex Query Crafting:** Mastered the art of advanced SQL, merging tables like a pro and wielding clauses for ninja-level table maneuvers.
- **ðŸ“Š Data Aggregation:** Got cozy with GROUP BY and turned aggregate functions like COUNT() and AVG() into my data-summarizing sidekicks.
- **ðŸ’¡ Analytical Wizardry:** Leveled up my real-world puzzle-solving skills, turning questions into actionable, insightful results.

# Conclusions

The "120 Years of Olympic Games: A Comprehensive Review" project successfully transformed raw Olympic Games data into a visually engaging and informative dashboard using Power BI. By leveraging data cleaning, normalization, and visualization techniques, the project provided stakeholders with a comprehensive tool to explore and understand historical trends, top performers, and key factors influencing the Olympic Games over more than a century.
